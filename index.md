### What Software Engineering means to me:

  Software Engineering is a course for teaching students to develop software. We are supposed to gain knowledge about how to develop software in this course, such as applications, websites or games. The most important is the process of engineering software and certification including software specification, software design, software construction, software testing, software maintenance. 


### Why are you taking Software Engineering and what you hope to get out the class:

  I am taking this class because I want to be an application or web developer in the future. Software Engineering is a good class for me so far to get into Software developing field. I hope I can gain some knowledge of frontend and backend. I can get familiar with the whole processing of developing the software application.  Moreover, I want to know more about how to test codes or debug codes because I think this is also an important skill we need in the future career. 

### What do you agree with in the chapter?  What do you find confusing or disagree with?  Was there anything that you found interesting or surprising?

  I agree that as a developer, we have to communicate on many levels. Communication is an important part of developing software. I think good programmers need to communicate well with their teams. They work with users and they need to know what users went from them and try to understand users' needs. They write code which communicates their intentions to a machine and documents their thinking for future generations of the developer. The author listed a few ways to help us be good at communicating with our team members or users. 
  I don't have any confusion. However, from the story of Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs, I think the soldiers are good liers at one level. They use three stone to swindle the ingredients from the villagers. 
  The interesting I found is the Broken Window Theory. "Don't Live with Broken Windows" every developer needs to keep it in mind. As a good developer, we know there is no perfect program or code, but we need to attempt to approach the perfect. "Don't leave 'broken windows' unrepaired. Fix each one as soon as it is discovered." This theory can be used everywhere. As a human being, Broken Windows are the shortcomings that we need to fix to be a better person. As a coding programmer, Broken Windows are the flaws in your code that might destroy the whole program. "Take some action to prevent further damage and to show that you are on top of the situation"

### chapter 2 
### What do you agree with in the chapter?  What do you find confusing or disagree with?  Was there anything that you found interesting or surprising?
  the first important thing is Orthogonality. I really agree that orthogonality is important for every program. As a great program, the components should be self-contained with indenpendent, and with a single, well-defined purpose. each component of the program should be independend. The error from one part should not affect others. 
The ones I am interested in are Coding and Testing. They are the two important parts for developers or programmers. As a great programmer, we need to make sure our code is clean first, variables' name is easy to read and track, and read commons for some part of your code in order for other people to read and understand. make sure the code is readable and reliable. The testing is also important because we all make mistakes. Some of those mistakes are unimportant, but some of them are expensive or dangerous. We need to check everything and anything we produce because things can always go wrong. we are humans and humans make mistakes all the time.
Moreover, I am interested in the Typical layer diagram. It shows me a briefly orthogonal system. I am wondering why the business logic is in this layer. I think it should separate from this diagram and move it to the specification or requirement. It should happen before we design the project.
