### What Software Engineering means to me:

  Software Engineering is a course for teaching students to develop software. We are supposed to gian knowledge about how to develop software in this course, such as applications, websites or games. The most important is the process of engineering software and critification including software specification, software design, software construction, software teasting, software maintenance. 


###Why are you taking Software Engineering and what you hope to get out the class:

  I am taking this class because I want to be an application or web developer in the future. Software Engineering is a good class for me so far to get into Software developing field. I hope I can gain some knowledge of frontend and backend. I can get familiar with the whole processing of developing the software application.
